Unfortunately, Posterous is on a way to close it's services.
I have reviewed number of blogging solutions, and have chosen the most proprietary one - static blog :)
For now I want to give a try to Jekyll.

### What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a parsing engine bundled as a ruby gem used to build static websites from
dynamic components such as templates, partials, liquid code, markdown, etc. Jekyll is known as "a simple, blog aware, static site generator".

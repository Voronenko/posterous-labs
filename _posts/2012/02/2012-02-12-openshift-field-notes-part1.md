Well, what do we need in order to become more familiar with 'developer havens' by Redhat?

Developer's account of course. You may apply for free using address below:

Next step - setup control enviroment. Historically, I find cygwin unnecessary on windows (especially taking into consideration powershell from Microsoft).
That's why to avoid installing couple of strange software packs in your core system - virtual vmware box or XP mode is your choice.

I am providing screenshots from XPMode, because type of work  windows allows such feature.

Instalaltion steps are clearly explained in Redhat Openshift documentation:
Install cygwin: (link 1)
select openssh, ruby,  classic make, gcc, git.

If you are advanced unix user, you can also install vi and other utilities you are familiar with.
For basic file editing far is enough (everything resides on NTFS)

While dependencies are being downloaded, you have enough time for a coffee (especially on ADSL connection)

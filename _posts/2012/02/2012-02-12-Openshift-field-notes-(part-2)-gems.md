Well, coffe break is over, and we still have some time to experiment

We have enough time to install Ruby gems



Steps order:

Go to project site:

http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems/

download zipped installation into folder,

unpack it (good advise to choose clear and short path to folder)

install it (remember about  unix style directory separators, i.e.. recommended path could be for example

$ ruby /cygdrive/c/rubygems/setup.rb



Please be patient while installation is running. On complete type the following command line instruction:

$ gem install rhc

you are now done with RHC tools installation

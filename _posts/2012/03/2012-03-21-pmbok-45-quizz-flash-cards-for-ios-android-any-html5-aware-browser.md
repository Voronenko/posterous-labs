Next labs topic - small html5 application to check your knowledge of PMBok processes.

Attention: PMI currently develops next version of the PMBOK - 5th edition. Current application uses some titles from PMBok5 (clearly indicated), also some processes (Stakeholders/Communications) are given as in draft due to usefulness.

Once PMBOK5 will be officially published,  I will update this application.

Technology used: HTML5, twitter bootstrap, html5 offline cache, javascript, MVVM framework

Let us adapt UI for mobile devices from the very beginning.

Thus, 'Ask me' button - asks random question for some of process groups.

Only one random part of the process is shown - inputs, tools or techniques or outputs.

Player needs to correctly determine fragment type (input, tool, output) & correctly specify process name.

For touch devoces - special kind of filter is implemented below. You can neither type part of the name in the input box, or use some of predefined words pn the blue buttons.

If you believe, it is not enough information given to determine process name - you have an option to press the hint button - you will see inputs, tools, outputs, but not the process name.

Once answer is ready, player can press check button - to see if he guessed right.

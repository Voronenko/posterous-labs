#Introduction
Visual Event is an open source Javascript bookmarklet which provides debugging information about events that have been attached to DOM elements. Visual Event shows:

Which elements have events attached to them

The type of events attached to an element

The code that will be run with the event is triggered

The source file and line number for where the attached function was defined (Webkit browsers and Opera only)

#How to use

Navigate to author's page, locate the bookmarklet, and drag to favorites bar.

#How it works?
Bookmarklet supports number of widely used javascript libraries, like  jQuery 1.2+, YUI 2,MooTools 1.2+, Prototype 1.6+,Glow as well as Dom 0 events, i.e. 'onclick'. etc.

Example of use:  you navigate to site that is built using one of specified above libraries, and bookmarklet visually highlights element with attached events,  as well as shows  source of the event subscriber function.

 Let's demonstrate on example of the DOU website:

<div class="p_embed p_image_embed">
<img src="/image/2013/01/46827775-ScreenHunter_68.jpg">
<img src="/image/2013/01/46827776-ScreenHunter_69.jpg">
<img src="/image/2013/01/46827777-ScreenHunter_70.jpg">
</div>
